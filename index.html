        <h2>Shutter Island</h2>
        <p>A psychological thriller that follows the story of a US Marshall investigating an asylum on Shutter Island.
        </p>

        <p>Disclaimer, these few paragraphs contain spoilers. </p>

        <p>If there were one plot twist ending movie that was my absolute favorite, it would be Shutter Island. I
            remember watching it for the first time and what an experience that was. This movie is a bit dark and a
            little bit unsettling due to the fact that it takes place in an insane asylum, so I would not recommend it
            to everyone. Psychological thriller movie lovers should definitely watch this movie as it will guarantee to
            leave you absolutely baffled in the end.
        </p>
        <p>Shutter Island follows the story of the character U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and his mission to investigate
            some suspicious things that have been happening at the Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane on
            Shutter Island alongside his new partner whom he had just met on the boat ride to the asylum. As the movie
            progresses, strange things keep happening and Teddy starts getting suspicious of the staff and starts having
            strange headaches. These unsual events continue to happen until Teddy starts having disturbing visions and
            flashbacks of his experiences as a U.S. Army soldier which start to mess with his head and his reality. The
            movie ends with Teddy in a room with the head psychiatrist Dr. John Cawley and his “partner” Chuck Aule who
            tell him shocking news. They explain to Teddy that he has actually been a patient at the asylum for 2 years
            and has been in a psychotic break the whole time and that all the staff on the island were playing along in
            his delusion to hopefully bring him back to reality once and for all.</p>
        <p>I absolutely adore this movie because of how unexpected the ending is. The first time watching this movie is
            definitely the best because you are unaware of the huge plot twist to come, but watching it back a second
            and even a third time is super interesting because you can pick up on things you missed previously. Noticing
            the way the staff look at Teddy as if they are worried he could hurt them is a very cool perspective to have
            while knowing the reality of the movie. Shutter Island easily gets a 10/10 for me.
